# google-books-search
## Description 

The purpose of this project is to create an application that will allow a user to search for Books using the Google Books Search App and then save any books found to be referenced later. The application makes use of React components to live update any search results on the page. This application must also use Node and Express to set up server side functionality and MongoDB to create and store the database information.


The Application is hosted on [Heroku](https://quiet-sierra-28526.herokuapp.com/).

You can find the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rconat/google-books-search).

## Usage 

This application is available to any user who wishes search Google Books to find books. The user can then view details about the books or save the book to a database which is viewable on the "saved" page. On the saved page the user can again view the details of any saved books or the user may delete the book from the saved list. 

## Credits

This project was completed by Ryan Conat working alongside professors and TAs through Trinity and Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to provide the file structure and directories as well as the assignment parameters.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
